#problem  #sirt3 

[[BIOIO-1001]] binds [[SIRT3]]

this is [[zero shot learning]] [[affinity ranking]] problem

## questions 
* does SIRT3 have known bound ligands with binding affinity? can they be used to turn the task into a [[few shot learning]] problem?

## hypothesis 
[[diffdock is a sota affinity ranking model]]

## experiment
[[what is the ranking of BIOIO-1001 in an affinity ranking against SIRT3 when using the diffdock model?]]
