1. [[phenotypic screens]] for [[insulin sensitivity]] identifies [[BIOIO-1001]]
2. [[BIOIO-1001]] - [[hydroxamic acid]] class, derived from [[thiazolidinedione]] ([[pioglitazone]] is a member)
3. no activity against [[PPARgamma]], [[pyruvate]] carriers and [[nuclear hormone receptor]]
4. genome-wide [[CRISPRa]] [[CRISPR screen]]
	1. downregulation of [[mTOR signaling]] via [[mTORC1]] and [[insulin signaling]]
	2. upregulation of [[NAD]] pathway
5. [[BIOIO-1001]] increased rate of [[fatty acids]] [[beta oxidation]], increased abundance of [[phosphatidic acid PA]] ([[LPIN1]] substrate) and decreased abundance of [[diacylglycerol DG]] ([[LPIN1]] product) 
6. [[BIOIO-1001]] reduced [[insulin]] secretion in [[mice]] on [[high fat diet]] - similar to [[pioglitazone]]
7. [[HTF-C]] - [[high sugar diet]] with reduced [[NASH]] phenotype relative to control and [[pioglitazone]] for [[BIOIO-1001]]
8. [[RNASeq]] of [[BIOIO-1001]] treated tissue on [[high fat diet]] shows gene expression patterns seen in [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (the link is not clear to me)
9. treatment of ALS mice with the candidate increased [[life expectancy]] in [[SOD1]] models of [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]]

## [[method]]

[[K562]] - 50uM 

## [[CRISPRa]] screen  - [[IDEAS]]
* [[sensitization]] in red
* [[resistance]] in blue

"The putative mechanism of action of BIOIO-1001 is where the hits flip from resistance to sensitizing to resistance or vice versa (highlighted in gray) in both the mTORC1 and NAD+ pathways."

[[decomposing drug activity into gene perturbation space]] & [[genetic interaction]] pattern: 
* activation of an inhibitor of [[mTORC1]] led to reduced [[viability]]  (= [[sensitization]])
* activation of an activator of [[mTORC1]] led to increased [[viability]]
* activation of a downstream inhibitor of  [[mTORC1]] leads to reduced [[viability]]

is there a link here with [[directional genetic interaction]]

increased [[SIRT3]] expression via [[CRISPRa]] appears to decrease [[cell viability]] in the presence of [[BIOIO-1001]] -> [[sensitivity]]

## questions
[[pioglitazone]] with similar profile than [[BIOIO-1001]]?
